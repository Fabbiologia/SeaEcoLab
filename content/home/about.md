# Description

The Seascape Ecology Lab (SeaEcoLab) is a newly formed division of the Bioengeneering and Environmental Science Laboratory (BICA) @ UABCS, its goal is to use cutting-edge techniques of numerical ecology, data science and remote sensing to describe space-time dynamics of marine communities and their habitats.
