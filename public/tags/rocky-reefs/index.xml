      <description>&amp;ldquo;The Gulf of California, once branded as “the Aquarium of the World” due to its high biodiversity and pool of unique species, is subject to increasing fishing pressure and habitat transformation, threatening its biodiversity. Using a database of 17 years of ecological underwater surveys in the rocky reefs of the region, our temporal analyses revealed a generalized loss of richness for species of fishes and epibenthic invertebrates. Moreover, a significant rise of Sea Surface Temperatures (SST) is prompting a tropicalization of the invertebrate community in the region, where species that historically inhabited the subtropical transitional areas in the GOC, reduced their spatial range, while being displaced by species with tropical affinities.</description>
