However, the process is not straightforward, the main limitation being the need for field data. The Self-calibrated Spectral Supervised Shallow-water Modeler (4SM) method was tested to obtain coastal bathymetry without the use of any field data. Using Landsat-8 multispectral images from 2013 to 2016, a bathymetric time series was produced. Groundtruthed depths and an alternative method, Stumpf’s Band Ratio Algorithm, were used to verify the results. Retrieved (4SM) vs groundtruthed depths scored an average r2 (0.90), and a low error (RMSE = 1.47 m). 4SM also showed, over the whole time series, the same average accuracy of the control method (40%). Advantages, limitations and operability under complex atmosphere and water column conditions, and high and low-albedo bottom processing capabilities of 4SM are discussed. In conclusion, the findings suggest that 4SM is as accurate as the commonly used Stumpf’s method, the only difference being the independence of 4SM from previous field data, and the potential to deliver bottom spectral characteristics for further modeling. 4SM thus represents a significant advance in coastal remote sensing potential to obtain bathymetry and optical properties of the marine bottom.","tags":["Coastal Remote Sensing"],"title":"Testing of the 4SM Method in the Gulf of California Suggests Field Data Are not Needed to Derive Satellite Bathymetry","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Y Morel","F Favoretto"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1502776800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1502776800,"objectID":"c90b2a4a84dc5cf32e6d0c3fabf1b0ca","permalink":"https://seaecolab.netlify.com/publication/4sm_yann/","publishdate":"2017-08-15T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/publication/4sm_yann/","section":"publication","summary":"All empirical water column correction methods have consistently been reported to require existing depth sounding data for the purpose of calibrating a simple depth retrieval model; they yield poor results over very bright or very dark bottoms. In contrast, we set out to (i) use only the relative radiance data in the image along with published data, and several new assumptions; (ii) in order to specify and operate the simplified radiative transfer equation (RTE); (iii) for the purpose of retrieving both the satellite derived bathymetry (SDB) and the water column corrected spectral reflectance over shallow seabeds. Sea truth regressions show that SDB depths retrieved by the method only need tide correction. Therefore it shall be demonstrated that, under such new assumptions, there is no need for (i) formal atmospheric correction; (ii) conversion of relative radiance into calibrated reflectance; or (iii) existing depth sounding data, to specify the simplified RTE and produce both SDB and spectral water column corrected radiance ready for bottom typing. Moreover, the use of the panchromatic band for that purpose is introduced. Altogether, we named this process the Self-Calibrated Supervised Spectral Shallow-sea Modeler (4SM). This approach requires a trained practitioner, though, to produce its results within hours of downloading the raw image. The ideal raw image should be a “near-nadir” view, exhibit homogeneous atmosphere and water column, include some coverage of optically deep waters and bare land, and lend itself to quality removal of haze, atmospheric adjacency effect, and sun/sky glint.","tags":["Coastal Remote Sensing"],"title":"4SM a novel method for water column correction","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\u0026ldquo;The Gulf of California (GOC), once branded as “the Aquarium of the World” due to its high biodiversity and pool of unique species, is subject to increasing fishing pressure and habitat transformation, threatening its biodiversity. Using a database of 17 years of ecological underwater surveys in the rocky reefs of the region, our temporal analyses revealed a generalized loss of richness for species of fishes and epibenthic invertebrates. Moreover, a significant rise of Sea Surface Temperatures (SST) is prompting a tropicalization of the invertebrate community in the region, where species that historically inhabited the subtropical transitional areas in the GOC, reduced their spatial range, while being displaced by species with tropical affinities. Analyzing community differences among reefs trough time using the Local Contribution to Beta Diversity index, we observed that the coupled effects of the defaunation and tropicalization prompted a spatial biotic homogenization over the region, making reefs more similar through time. Finally, we found that well-enforced no-take areas can buffer the long-term homogenization of specific reefs, such as Cabo Pulmo National Park. This suggest that overfishing might be an important driver of fish biomasses degradation in the region. The longer-term outcomes of the processes of defaunation, tropicalization and biotic homogenization over ecosystems are still largely unknown. Continuing the support of ecological monitoring programs is, therefore, far-reaching not only to record such effects, but also to identify areas that could serve as last refugia to preserve the biodiversity of a region that once attracted the attention of researchers from around the globe.\u0026rdquo;\n","date":1461736800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461736800,"objectID":"fc8cc1f59c43aa55c382a60788342022","permalink":"https://seaecolab.netlify.com/project/rocky-reefs-community/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/project/rocky-reefs-community/","section":"project","summary":"Community ecology of fish and invertebrates associated to the rocky reefs in the Gulf of California.
